# RESTful APIs

## Definition

A **RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API)** is a style of designing web services where communication happens over HTTP using a **stateless, resource-based architecture**.

In REST, everything is treated as a **resource** such as:

* users
* orders
* products
* blog posts

Each resource is identified using a **unique URL**, and clients interact with resources using standard HTTP methods like **GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE**.

REST is not a protocol or standard. It is an **architectural style** that follows a specific set of principles.

## Why RESTful APIs Are Used

REST APIs are widely used because they are:

* simple to design and understand
* scalable and stateless
* language and platform independent
* based on standard HTTP operations
* easy to integrate across services and clients

They are ideal for:

* web applications
* mobile backends
* microservice communication
* cloud-native systems

---

## Key Principles of REST

REST has six fundamental architectural constraints.

---

### 1. Client–Server Architecture

The client (browser, mobile app) and server remain independent.

* client handles UI/interaction
* server handles data storage and business logic

This separation improves scalability and maintainability.

---

### 2. Statelessness

Each API call must contain **all the required information** to process the request.

The server does not store client session state.

* no stored context between requests
* improves reliability
* easy horizontal scaling

If state is needed, store it in:

* client
* cookies
* tokens (JWT)

---

### 3. Cacheability

Responses can be marked as **cacheable** to reduce latency and load.

Caching improves:

* performance
* throughput
* user experience

Headers like:

* Cache-Control
* ETag
* Expires

are used to control caching behavior.

---

### 4. Uniform Interface

REST uses a **consistent resource-based interface**, meaning:

* common HTTP verbs
* standardized URI structure
* uniform response formats (usually JSON)

This makes APIs predictable and easier to use.

---

### 5. Layered System

A client does not need to know:

* whether it communicates with actual server
* or proxy, gateway, or load balancer

This allows:

* CDNs
* API gateways
* security layers

without changing the API contract.

---

### 6. Code on Demand (Optional)

Servers may return executable code, such as:

* JavaScript
* applets

This constraint is rarely used in practice.

---

## REST Resources and Endpoints

Resources are represented using **nouns**, not verbs.

Examples:

| Resource    | Endpoint               |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Users       | `/users`               |
| Single User | `/users/{id}`          |
| Orders      | `/orders`              |
| Blog posts  | `/posts/{id}/comments` |

Guideline:

* avoid verbs in URLs
* use plural nouns
* use hierarchical resource structure

---

## HTTP Methods in RESTful APIs

---

### GET

Used to **retrieve data**.

Characteristics:

* safe (does not modify server data)
* idempotent
* can be cached

Example:

```
GET /users/10
```

---

### POST

Used to **create new resource**.

Example:

```
POST /users
```

Request body contains user details.

Not idempotent.

---

### PUT

Used to **update or replace an entire resource**.

Example:

```
PUT /users/10
```

Replaces user with ID 10.

Idempotent operation.

---

### PATCH

Used to **partially update** a resource.

Example:

```
PATCH /users/10
```

Updates only specific fields.

Not always idempotent.

---

### DELETE

Used to **remove a resource**.

Example:

```
DELETE /users/10
```

Idempotent because repeated deletes have same effect.

---

## Request and Response Format

Most REST APIs use:

* JSON
* sometimes XML or YAML

Typical JSON response:

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

## Status Codes in REST

| Code | Meaning               |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    |
| 201  | Created               |
| 204  | No Content            |
| 400  | Bad Request           |
| 401  | Unauthorized          |
| 403  | Forbidden             |
| 404  | Not Found             |
| 409  | Conflict              |
| 500  | Internal Server Error |

HTTP status codes communicate result meaningfully.

---

## REST API Design Best Practices

* use nouns not verbs in URLs

* version APIs (`/api/v1/users`)

* use proper HTTP status codes

* support filtering, sorting, and pagination

* use HTTPS

* document APIs (Swagger/OpenAPI)

* provide meaningful error messages

* implement authentication & authorization

## RESTful APIs vs SOAP vs GraphQL (Short)

| Feature     | REST          | GraphQL        | SOAP     |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Style       | Architectural | Query language | Protocol |
| Data format | JSON (common) | JSON           | XML      |
| Flexibility | Medium        | Very high      | Low      |
| Overhead    | Low           | Medium         | High     |
| Real-time   | Limited       | Subscriptions  | No       |

---

## Advantages of RESTful APIs

* easy to understand and implement

* scalable and stateless

* widely adopted

* supports caching

* works over standard HTTP

---

## Limitations of RESTful APIs

* over-fetching (client may receive extra data)

* under-fetching (may require multiple calls)

* not ideal for complex relationships

* lacks built-in real-time support

---

## Summary

RESTful APIs provide a **simple and scalable way to design web services** using standard HTTP operations. They treat everything as a resource, provide stateless communication, support caching, and scale naturally in distributed environments.

They are ideal for most modern backend systems, especially microservices and web/mobile applications, but may face limitations where **graph-style queries or real-time features** are required.
