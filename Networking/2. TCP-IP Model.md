# TCP/IP Model 

![OSI vs TCP/IP](images/tcp_vs_udp.jpg)

- **Definition**: `TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)` is the collection of network protocols and organization of these protocols in different layers for modeling the network.

- It has four layers, `Application`, `Transport`, `Internet` and `Network Access`.

- While the OSI model has seven layers, the 4 layer TCP/IP model is simpler and commonly used in today’s Internet and networking systems.

### Layers in TCP/IP

1. **Application Layer**  

    - The Application Layer is the top layer of the TCP/IP model and the one closest to the user.
    
    - It acts like a bridge between your software (like Chrome, Gmail, or WhatsApp) and the lower layers of the network that actually send and receive data.

    - Protocols: **HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS**  

    - Responsible for delivering services to the user.  

    - Manages things like `data formatting`, so both sender and receiver understand the data, `encryption` to keep data safe, and `session management` to keep track of ongoing connections.

2. **Transport Layer**  

    - The Transport Layer is responsible for making sure that data is sent reliably and in the correct order between devices.
    
    - Protocols: **TCP and UDP**, depending on whether the communication needs to be reliable or faster.

    - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
        
        - **TCP** is used when data must be correct and complete, like when loading a web page or downloading a file.

        - Connection oriented, slower

        - Example: Web browsing, email.  
   
    - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**  
        
        -  **UDP** is faster but doesn’t guarantee delivery, useful for things like live video or online games where speed matters more than perfect accuracy.

        - Connectionless, faster but less reliable.  
        
        - No retransmission, no guarantee of order.  
        
        - Example: Video streaming, gaming, VoIP.  

3. **Internet Layer**  

    - The Internet Layer is used for finding the best path for data to travel across different networks so it can reach the right destination. 

    - It helps data packets move from one network to another until they reach the correct device. 

    - This layer uses the `Internet Protocol (IP)` to give every device a unique IP address, which helps identify where data should go.

    - The main job of this layer is `routing` deciding the best way for data to travel.
   
    - Protocols: **IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP**

4. **Network Access Layer (Link Layer)**  
    
    - It deals with the actual physical connection between devices on the same local network like computers connected by cables or communicating through Wi-Fi. 

    - It makes sure that data can travel over the hardware, such as wires, switches, or wireless signals. 

    - Deals with hardware addressing (MAC addresses), Ethernet, Wi-Fi.

## Data Transmission Flow (Sender vs Receiver)

| **Sender (When Sending Data)** | **Receiver (When Receiving Data)** |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Application Layer**: Prepares user data using protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP. | **Application Layer**: Delivers final data to the correct application (e.g., displays webpage in browser). |
| **Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)**: Breaks data into segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). Ensures reliability (TCP) or speed (UDP). | **Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)**: Reassembles segments, checks for errors, ensures data is complete. |
| **Internet Layer (IP)**: Adds IP addresses, determines best routing path for each packet. | **Internet Layer (IP)**: Checks IP address, strips IP header, forwards data to Transport Layer. |
| **Link Layer (Network Access Layer)**: Converts packets into frames → bits, sends them over physical medium (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.). | **Link Layer (Network Access Layer)**: Receives bits, reconstructs frames, passes data upward. |
