# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

## Definition

**Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** is a system design pattern where **components communicate by producing and reacting to events** instead of direct synchronous calls.

An **event** represents something that has already happened in the system, such as:

* order placed
* payment completed
* user registered
* item shipped

Services **emit events** and other services **listen and react** to them asynchronously.

---

## Why Event-Driven Architecture Is Needed

In large-scale systems, direct service-to-service communication leads to:

* tight coupling
* cascading failures
* poor scalability
* difficulty adding new features

EDA solves this by:

* decoupling services
* enabling asynchronous processing
* allowing systems to scale independently
* supporting real-time and reactive systems

## How Event-Driven Architecture Works

1. A service performs an action (e.g., order created).

2. It emits an **event** describing what happened.

3. The event is published to an **event broker** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SNS).

4. One or more **consumers** subscribe to the event.

5. Each consumer processes the event independently.

The producer does **not know** who consumes the event.

## Core Components

### Event Producer

* Generates and publishes events.
* Represents the source of truth for the event.
* Does not wait for consumers.

### Event Broker

* Routes, stores, or streams events.
* Decouples producers and consumers.
* Examples: Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS.

### Event Consumer

* Subscribes to events.
* Reacts by performing some action.
* Multiple consumers can process the same event.

## Event vs Message

| Aspect        | Event                   | Message                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Meaning       | Something that happened | Instruction to do something  |
| Mutability    | Immutable               | May be processed and removed |
| Consumers     | One or many             | Usually one                  |
| Typical usage | EDA, streaming          | Task queues                  |

Events describe **facts**, not commands.

## Common Event-Driven Patterns

### Publish–Subscribe

* One event → multiple consumers.
* Most common EDA pattern.

### Event Streaming

* Events stored for a period of time.
* Consumers can replay past events.
* Used heavily with Kafka.

### Event Notification

* Lightweight events trigger side effects.
* Example: sending emails, notifications.

## Use Cases of Event-Driven Architecture

* microservices communication
* real-time analytics
* notification systems
* audit logging
* data pipelines
* activity feeds

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages                     | Disadvantages                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Loose coupling                 | Increased complexity               |
| Scalability                    | Eventual consistency               |
| Extensibility                  | Debugging challenges               | 
| Asynchronous processing        | Message loss potential             |
| Real-time reactions            | Operational overhead               |

## When to Use Event-Driven Architecture

**Use EDA when:**

* multiple services react to same action

* system needs to scale independently

* asynchronous processing is acceptable

* real-time or near-real-time reactions are needed

**Avoid EDA when:**

* strong consistency is mandatory
* workflow is simple and synchronous

---

## Summary

* Event-Driven Architecture uses **events** as the primary communication mechanism.

* Producers emit events without knowing consumers.

* Consumers react asynchronously and independently.

* EDA enables **loose coupling, scalability, and extensibility**.

* Commonly implemented using Kafka, RabbitMQ, and cloud messaging systems.
