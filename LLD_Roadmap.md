# Low-Level Design (LLD) Roadmap

This roadmap covers everything you need to study for **Low-Level Design Interviews**, with a focus on **OOP, principles, design patterns, and practice problems**.

---

## 1. Foundations of LLD
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes & Objects
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- Interfaces & Abstract Classes
- Static vs. Dynamic Binding
- Composition vs. Inheritance
- Access Modifiers & Visibility

---

## 2. Design Principles
- **SOLID Principles**
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
- Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)

---

## 3. UML & Diagrams
- **Class Diagrams**
- Sequence Diagrams
- Activity Diagrams
- State Diagrams
- Use Case Diagrams
- Component Diagrams
- Deployment Diagrams

---

## 4. Design Patterns
### Creational Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory

---

## 5. Concurrency in LLD

---

## 7. Testing & Best Practices
